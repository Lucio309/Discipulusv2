# 🧪 Phishing Awareness Page

This is a **phishing simulation project** created for educational purposes to help demonstrate how phishing attacks work and how users can recognize them.

## 🔍 Project Description

This fake login page mimics a real-world login form to simulate what a phishing attack might look like. When the user tries to "log in", the page does **not** collect or send any real data — instead, it displays a **warning message** that educates the user about phishing risks.
